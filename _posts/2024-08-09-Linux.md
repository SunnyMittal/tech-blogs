[How to change directory permissions in Linux](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions)

```
u - user
g - group
o - owner
a - all

+ - add permission
- - remove permission

r - read
w - write
x - execute

-rwxr--r--
or
dr--r--r--
or
|r--r--r--

meaning of above 3
- - file
d - directory
| - link

first set of rwx or r-- is for owner of file/directory/link
second set of r-- is for members of the group owning the file
third set of r-- is for other users

These three represent 3 permission groups for owner, owner group and all users.
